Object detection with HSV masking. Found upper and lower HSV 
Contours and filtering contours based on shape and size, circularity in cv (Blob detection)
kalman filter for tracking 


Since hsv couldn't be found exactly for the ball, other white regions where also where there so use Blob detection and then compared the area between range 200 & 2000.
Kalman filters where applied on detected ball if ball not detected based on the prev location next possible locations where predicted and tracked!
